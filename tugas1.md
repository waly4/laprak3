## q1: what am i interested in learning currently

seeing the state of the world and the fact that i am a university student, i have to focus on so many different things and subject. i have to learn new unfamiliar subjects to my geophysical major, a lot of lab hours and *ofcourse* lots lots of lab reports. but so far, i'm enjoying it. the feeling that i know that other of my friends also suffering the same thing creates big relief in my soul. they are also helpful and so open about everything. all the lab assistant also kind and generous. and not to talk about the lecturers who are absolutely smart *and* could teach!

i also learn a lot about the coding and computer world. first we're acquired to do so, and second, i kind of like it. although it took time and energy, it's fun! i like to learn languages and programming languages is one of them *apparently*. i talked to strangers online, talks in english (*mostly*), german, russia, arab, spanish, french, etc etc. i like the diversity and the story 'tower of babel'

## q2: what's my favorite hobby

**reading**, no doubt. everytime i open my phone i only realized that all of my media i consume must or just entirely consist of **texts**. at some point in my life i enjoy reading lecture notes and powerpoints, ah those times. i like to read and collect books. yes, collect, because who doesn't want to add to their wooden rack new stacks of books that reeks of *bibliosma*, the smell of books (i just googled it so don't think i'm a nerd (i am)). 

**cinema**. i gave it period because *sigh*. the fact that so many people put their blood, sweat, and tears into it. gave us one to three hours of art. it's mind bending. gave us new perspective about reality. and my friend is an actor and i watch all the behind the scenes of movies and series. it's fun to know how things works, how actor and actress works. i also watch lotta series in my tv (my sister's tv ofc), buying subscription in the sake of quality. i like, **love** visual and auditory pleasure. i like going to the movie theatre, listen to music with good media (dolby, sony, God bless you all), and a dim lighted things because i have a photo-phobic eyes (why do i have them while i have brown eyes? it's unfair, really).

**MUSIC**. i'm going to quote Stevie Wonder's Sir Duke here, if you all may.

*Music is a world within itself*
*With a language we all understand*
*With an equal opportunity*
*For all to sing, dance and clap their hands*

*But just because a record has a groove*
*Don't make it in the groove*
*But you can tell right away at letter A*
*When the people start to move*

*They can feel it all over*
*But they can feel it all over people*
*They can feel it all over*
*They can feel it all over people, no, yeah*

## q3: learning github and git

big props to all the assistants for being so patient towards us newbie and being so thorough on making us understand how these new unfamiliar things works. i adore and bless you guys all. 

## i won't be sorry for writing this report like a blog since the instruction said i could do whatever i want with it. and thank you if you read until this point. byee<3
